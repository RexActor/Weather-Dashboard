# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Page created in Js. Using OpenWeather API you are able to get weather based on location search

Using 2 API's. Due that weather forecast is based on Longitude & Latitude, we required to get these values first by using API for GeoCoding.
When we got Lat & Lon for your desired city, we simply use these values to get 5 day forecast

- 1st using [GeoCoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) API to get Lat & Lon for your desired city
- 2nd using [5 Day Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) API to get 5 day forecast based on Lat & Lon
